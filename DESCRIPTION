Description: This package allows you to easily conduct a Pattern
    Component Modelling (PCM) analysis on Representational Similarity
    Analysis (RSA) data (e.g. from functional brain imaging data) in
    R. PCM allows you to take a set of hypothetical structures - Independent
    Pattern Components, or IPCs - by which data might be represented in a given 
    brain region - and compare these structures to your data to determine which
    hypothesis best fits your data using a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
    metric. For more details on PCM analysis, see Kryklywy, Ehlers, Beukers, et al., 2020.
