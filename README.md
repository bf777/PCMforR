# PCMforR
Pattern Component Modelling for R

This package allows you to easily conduct a Pattern
Component Modelling (PCM) analysis on Representational Similarity
Analysis (RSA) data (e.g. from functional brain imaging data) in
R. PCM allows you to take a set of hypothetical structures - Independent
Pattern Components, or IPCs - by which data might be represented in a given
brain region - and compare these structures to your data to determine which
hypothesis best fits your data using a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
metric. For more details on PCM analysis, see [Kryklywy, Ehlers, Beukers, et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.24.310383).

## Acknowledgments:
The code underpinning this package was conceptualized and written by Dr. James Kryklywy (james.kryklywy[at]gmail.com). It was
reformatted into an R package by Brandon Forys (brandon.forys[at]alumni.ubc.ca). The project was supervised by
Dr. Rebecca Todd (becket.todd[at]psych.ubc.ca) at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, Canada.
