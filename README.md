# PCMforR
Pattern Component Modelling for R

This package allows you to easily conduct a Pattern
Component Modelling (PCM) analysis on Representational Similarity
Analysis (RSA) data (e.g. from functional brain imaging data) in
R. PCM allows you to take a set of hypothetical structures - Patterns
of Interest, or POIs - by which data might be represented in a given
brain region - and compare these structures to your data to determine which
hypothesis best fits your data using a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
metric. For any additional questions on functionality and use,
